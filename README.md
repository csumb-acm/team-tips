# Team Tips

Teams will be assembled by Local Hack Day organizers based on skill level into Beginner and Advanced divisions to ensure fair competition. The spirit of Local Hack Day is to celebrate and demonstrate engineering for the sake of engineering - setting aside all differences to come up with a solution to a problem.

- If you have four people working on separate aspects of your hack, one person should be responsible for integrating them smoothly.
- Each team is responsible for submitting at least 1 version of their code to our Github Organization before the code freeze (end of hacking) at
